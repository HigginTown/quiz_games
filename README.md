# Quiz games for the command line inspiried by JEOPARDY!

This is an interactive program on the command line which prompts you for an asnwer to a Jeopardy! question, all while tracking your score and randomzing the questions.

There are two games:

`play_word_games` covers about 50 categories of word-game style questions. These include more common categories like " CROSSWORD CLUES 'M' " and " 7-LETTER WORDS ", "ABBVR.", and "FOREIGN WORDS AND PHRASES", among others. There are about 5,000 questions. 


`play_jeopardy` conatains over 200,000 questions on a variety of topics. When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter key word filters as a list. This can be helpful if you want to focus on questions related to philosophy, for instance. 


Instructions: The main games run on Python 3, but I have made a Python 2 compatible folder. 

The questions are in the python pickles. 

`my_jeopardy.py` contains the classes and some other stuff.
